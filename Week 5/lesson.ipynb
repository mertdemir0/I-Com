    "\n",
    "- `np.arange()`: This function returns evenly spaced values within a given interval.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Pandas Operations**: With pandas, you can perform a variety of operations on your data such as calculations (addition, subtraction etc.), conditional operation(s), statistical operations (mean, median etc.), string and even more complex operations. Both series and dataframes support these operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Pandas provide several methods for you to quickly understand and explore your data. Some of these methods include `describe` (which provides a quick statistical summary of your data), `head` (which shows the first N rows of your data), `tail` (shows the last N rows), `shape` (shows the number of rows and columns in your data) and many more.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Python Control Structures**: In Python, you have control structures that direct the flow of your program. You have conditional statements (`if-elif-else`) that run certain blocks of code based on specific conditions. Then you also have loops (`for` and `while`) that run a block of code multiple times. The `for` loop often iterates over a sequence (like a list or a string) whereas a `while` loop runs as long as a certain condition is met.\n"

    "## Detailed Walkthrough of Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pandas Operations Example Walkthrough:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first example, we have a pandas Series named 's':\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s = pd.Series(['Tom', 'William Rick', 'John', 'Alber@t', np.nan, '1234','SteveSmith'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "which consists of several string (text) values, including names, a string with a special character '@', a number written as a string '1234', and a missing value represented as `np.nan`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `s.str.lower()`: This operation is converting all the string values in 's' to lower case.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `s.str.upper()`: This operation is converting all the string values in 's' to upper case.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `s.str.len()`: This operation is calculating the length of each string value in 's' (the number of characters), and returning that as a Series of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "These operations are helping us manipulate and understand the string data in pandas Series or DataFrame. If this were a real dataset, we could use these operations to standardize text values, derive new characteristics from our data, and clean it for further analysis.\n",
    "\n"

    "### Additional String Operations Examples Walkthrough:\n",
    "\n",
    "These notable examples focus on more advanced string manipulation techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `s.str.replace('a', 'b')`: This operation replaces all occurrences of 'a' in the strings within the Series 's' with 'b'. This could be used when you need to replace specific characters or correct spelling errors across your dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `s.str.contains('A')`: This operation checks each string in the Series 's' to see if it contains the character 'A'. It returns a Series of Boolean values (True or False) representing whether 'A' was found in each string. This is particularly useful when you're looking to filter out or examine rows that contain a certain keyword or pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `s.str.count('a')`: This operation counts the number of times 'a' appears in each string in the Series 's'. The result is a Series of numbers representing these counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we create a new Series 's2':\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "s2 = pd.Series(['  A', 'B  ', '  C  '])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "which contains string values with leading and/or trailing whitespaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `s2.str.lstrip()`: This operation removes leading spaces from each string in the Series 's2'.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `s2.str.rstrip()`: This operation removes trailing spaces from each string in the Series 's2'.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `s2.str.strip()`: This operation removes both leading and trailing spaces from each string in the Series 's2'.\n",
    "\n",
    "These operations are useful in data cleaning processes where you need to remove unneeded whitespace from your text data.\n"

    "### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Examples Walkthrough:\n",
    "\n",
    "In the EDA examples, we assume we have a pandas DataFrame 'df'. We demonstrate various operations to explore and understand the data contained in 'df'.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `df.var()`: This operation calculates the variance of the values in each column in the DataFrame 'df'. Variance is a measure of how spread out the values are in a dataset or a column.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `df.corr()`: This operation calculates the correlation between each pair of numerical columns in the DataFrame 'df'. Correlation is a statistical measure that explains how one or more variables are related to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `df.cumsum()`: This operation applies a cumulative sum over each column in the DataFrame 'df'. A cumulative sum is a sequence of partial sums of a given sequence.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. `df.hist()`: This operation plots a histogram for each numerical column in the DataFrame 'df'. A histogram is a graphical representation that organizes a group of data points into a specified range.\n",
    "\n",
    "These EDA operations provide a quick and effective understanding of the underlying data which is essential before carrying out any further data analysis or data processing tasks.\n"

    "\n",
    "#### Conditional Statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, conditional statements are used to execute certain pieces of code based on specific conditions. You primarily use `if`, `elif` (short for 'else if'), and `else` for this purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "day = 'Sunday'\n",
    "\n",
    "if day == 'Sunday':\n",
    "    print('Today is the day of the sun.')\n",
    "elif day == 'Monday':\n",
    "    print('Today is the day of the moon.')\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print('Today is a weekday.')\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, we have a variable 'day' that contains the string 'Sunday'. The `if` statement checks if the value of 'day' is 'Sunday'. If it is, 'Today is the day of the sun.' is printed. The `elif` statement checks if the value of 'day' is 'Monday'. If it is, 'Today is the day of the moon.' is printed. If 'day' is neither 'Sunday' nor 'Monday', the `else` statement executes and 'Today is a weekday.' is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Loops:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides `for` and `while` loops to iterate over a block of code multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example of `for` loop:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "for number in numbers:\n",
    "    print(number)\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, we have a list of numbers from 1 to 5. The `for` loop iterates over each item in this list, and the `print` statement inside the loop prints the current item.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Example of `while` loop:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "i = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "while i < 5:\n",
    "    print(i)\n",
    "    i += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this example, we define a variable 'i' with an initial value of 0. The `while` loop keeps running as long as 'i' is less than 5. Within the loop, we first print the current value of 'i', then increment 'i' by 1. Once 'i' becomes 5, the `while` loop stops because the condition 'i < 5' is no longer True.\n"
